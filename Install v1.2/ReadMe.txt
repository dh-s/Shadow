This version of the macro will cast shadows of most entity types except for DataCAD's "Smart" entities. Note that polygons and slabs with more than 36 sides (in DataCAD versions 14 onwards) will not be processed fully (refer to instruction document for details).
If you would like to be advised of future versions, please visit my web site at dhsoftware.com.au and join my mailing list.
