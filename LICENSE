The source code (dcs file) and this document should always be distributed together with the compiled macro (dcx file).
You may modify this software for your own use without limitation.  If you convey a copy of the modified software to others, you may only do so under the following conditions:    

1. You convey your source code (dcs file) together with the compiled macro (dcx file).           
2. You leave this notice intact.  You should add an additional notice regarding your  changes, provided it does not in any way limit or modify the intention of this notice.
3. The original copyright remains, together with a notice of the modification and the name of the person(s) who made the modification.                                        
4. You do not charge for the software (including not charging for any distribution media unless explicit permission has been obtained from the author).
5. You allow your modified software to be freely distributed by others.               
6. You update the version number to indicate that it is your modification. Appending your initials to the original version number would be adequate for this purpose, potentially followed by a numeric version number of your own. (e.g. if Joe Smith produces a modification of version 1.0 of this software, he could version it as 1.0.js.01.  If Joe then makes a further modification he could version it as 1.0.js.01.1 if it is a minor fix or as 1.0.js.02 if it introduces new functionality.)
