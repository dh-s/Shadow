Can now select a shadow surface in any view (previously it forced you to plan view when selecting surface)
Some minor changes to the layer menu (you can now cancel out of the menu without making a selection)
All messages and function key labels are now stored in seperate files (making translation to other languages easy)
Set colour of created symbols so that correct shadow colour is retained if the symbol is exploded
